gnucobol-hello-world
====================
### Using
- https://superbol.eu/en/

```cmd
@REM working only for libcob-4.dll, not working for other built-in dependencies when gnucobol does not provide them as static libraries
set "COB_CFLAGS=-static" && cobc -verbose -static -x main.cob
```
### Notes
- For a self-contained, standalone exe, gnucobol binaries should also be built along with static libraries internally use (zlib, gmp, etc)
- > If you need to use a GCC compiler other than the one included in this package, you can use the tool gc-config to change the GCC compiler used by GnuCOBOL.
